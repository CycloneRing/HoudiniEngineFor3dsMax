# Houdini Engine for 3ds Max
Houdini Engine for 3ds Max is a 3ds Max plugin that allows deep integration of
Houdini technology into Autodesk 3ds Max through the use of Houdini Engine.

This plugin brings Houdini's powerful and flexible procedural workflow into 3ds
Max through Houdini Digital Assets. Artists can interactively adjust the asset's
parameters inside 3ds Max, and use 3ds Max geometries as an asset's inputs.
Houdini's procedural engine will then "cook" the asset and the results will be
available right inside 3ds Max.
